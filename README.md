 # Features:
 ## Theme
    The theme involves blue/green/grey colours which create a war-like theme as there is a battle between the user and the computer. 
    
    For the title I used grey as it matches with blue and it can be contrasted against so it can be easier to notice by the visually impaired


## Buttons
    each button is made fron the font awesome icons. When one of the 3 options are clicked the border of the icons would  turn green when you beat the computer red if you lose or blue if you draw with the computer. 
    
    This will allow it to be more convinient with individuals who perhaps have dyslexia or any other problems with reading. 
    
    Additionally there is text displayed when the user wins, draws or loses and the fact that what they chose beats the computers choice.
   
## Form
    When the user wins the game a form will appear which allows the user to enter in their email and receive their scores via email. 
    
    I added this feature as it allows the user to keep track of their scores as they play or if they want to show their friends. 
## Captions
    -I added some captions one of them comparing the users and computers choice and who wins e.g."Rock overpowerd paper, you win". 

    -Secondly, When you win or lose, a caption is displayed which shows how many rounds it took to win/lose against your opponent.
  # User stories:

    -I found it easy to get around the website.
    -I liked the idea of the icons glowing different colours depending if i won lost or had a draw.
    -The game is mobile friendly as the icons and scoreboard adapt to my screen. Instead of scattering around the page the icons are one on top of the other.

  ## Second-time user
    -When playing the game I noticed that when I won a box appeared asking me to enter in my email. I got sent an email showing me my scores.

    -Moreover, when I won It showed me how many rounds it took to beat the computer.

    -When I win/lose the scores reset so that I can play again if. Additionally there is a caption which allows me to know why I won or lost.

    -Whilst playing I like how everything is easy to tell the difference between the icons. Its very easy to navigate around as the colours are contrasting.

    The game seemed to be working the same way throughout the browsers Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Goggle Chrome. The email text was working andlead to the scores of the user and computer to be sent to their email.
