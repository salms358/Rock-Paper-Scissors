 # Features:
 ## Theme
    The theme involves blue/green/grey colours which create a war-like theme as there is a battle between the user and the computer. For the title I used grey as it matches with blue and it can be contrasted against so it canbe easier to notice by the vusually impaired


## Buttons
    each button is made fron the font awesome icons. When one of the 3 options are clicked the border of the icons would eithert turn green when you beat the computer red if you lose or blue if you draw with the computer. This will allow it to be more convinient with individuals who perhaps have dyslexia or any other problems with reading. Additionally there is text displayed when the user wins, draws or loses and the fact that what they chose beats the computers choice.
